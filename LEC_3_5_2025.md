# Density function $h$ of $\theta$ given $X$
$$f(\theta; X) = f(\theta; X_1, ..., X_n)$$

Using Bayes Rule:
$$h(\theta) = \frac{f(X; \theta)g(\theta)}{\int_\theta f(X;\theta)g(\theta)\ d\theta}$$

Where:
$$\int_\theta f(X;\theta)g(\theta)\ d\theta$$
is the marginal distribution of the data over all possible $\theta$.

And $h(\theta)$ represents the probability of observing $\theta$ at a constant given the observed data.

# Example
$$X_1, ..., X_n \sim^{idd} Exp(\lambda),\ \lambda > 0$$
$$\lambda \sim Exp(2)$$

$$h(\lambda) = \frac{\prod_{i = 1}^n (\lambda e^{-\lambda x_i})(2e^{-2\lambda})}{\int_0^\infty \lambda e^{-\lambda x_i} * 2e^{-2\lambda}\ d\lambda}$$

Note: we don't always have to evaluate the integral

You can replace the numerator with a constant $c$ because we know the distribution is going to be the same multiplied by a constant which is the integral below.

$$h(\lambda) = c \lambda^n e^{-\lambda (\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i + 2)}$$
$$h(\lambda) \propto \frac{(\lambda^*)^{\alpha^*}}{\Gamma(\alpha^*)} \lambda^{\alpha^* - 1} e^{-\lambda^* * \lambda}$$

Therefore: conditional on $X_1, ..., X_n$
$$\lambda \sim Gamma(\alpha^*, \lambda^*)$$
$$\alpha^* = n + 1$$
$$\lambda^* = \left[\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i\right] + 2$$

It is proportional to a Gamma distribution.

# Define Bayes Estimator for $\lambda$ given the data.
Under squared error loss, is the mean of this distribution.

I.e.
$$\hat \lambda_{bayes} = E[\lambda | X]$$
$$\hat \lambda_{bayes} = \frac{\alpha^*}{\lambda^*}$$
$$\hat \lambda_{bayes} = \frac{n + 1}{\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i + 2}$$

$$\hat \lambda_{MLE} = \frac{1}{\bar X}$$

# Possible Trivia question
When you have a larger sample size, your Expected values and Variance are closer to the values that would be solely determined by the data and farther away from what it would be specifically under your prior.

A prior with a smaller variance will force your base estimate to be a little farther away from the data based estimate and closer to your prior estimate.

$$E[\lambda | X] = \frac{\alpha + n}{\beta + \sum x_i}$$
$$E[\lambda | X] = \frac{\alpha + n}{(\beta + \sum x_i)^2}$$
